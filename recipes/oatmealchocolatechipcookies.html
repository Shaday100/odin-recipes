<h2>Description</h2>
    <body>As a self-proclaimed cookie enthusiast, this recipe is my absolute favorite go-to for a quick dessert treat! What's not to love? This delicious treat has just about everything I'd want in a cookie- they're soft, chewy, and best of all, easy to make! Most of these ingredients can be found easily in the kitchen, and the cookie dough is freezable if the portion turns out to be a tad excessive. </body>
